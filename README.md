# Describetion and question

A number of challenges will require you to create solutions which are more efficiently solved by making use of a programming language to automate and perform the computations. For this purpose, we recommend to make use of Python as well as complementary libraries such as requests and pwntools.

If you are not sure where to start with Python, we recommend the introductory Python 101 for Hackers course.

Click the ‚ÄòSTART CHALLENGE‚Äô button to the right of this text description to start a socket challenge. Utilise a programming language to interface with the socket and automate solving 500 simple addition problems to receive the flag. Take care when interfacing with unknown remote services - '\n' is not the only way to end.


# pre-requirement's
```
apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-dev git libssl-dev libffi-dev build-essential

python3 -m pip install --upgrade pwntools
```
